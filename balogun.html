    <div class="prose lg:prose-xl mx-auto">
      <p>
        By creation man was made in the class of God. Adam in the Garden of Eden,
        by God's wisdom, named all the animals one by one. But when he fell his
        wisdom was corrupted. It did not do away with the nature of God, but the
        nature of the devil—sin, wickedness, etc.—every mortal being shared this
        nature with Adam by natural birth. For the one born of the flesh is flesh
        and the one born of the Spirit is spirit (John 3:5–6; Romans 3:23).

        But thank God for Jesus who died for you, and He wants to spend eternity
        with you. You have a part to play: accept that Jesus Christ is your Lord
        and Savior. Pray this prayer:  
        “Lord Jesus, I am a sinner. Forgive me my sin. I know You died for me and
        rose on the third day. Jesus, wash me with Your blood, come into my heart.
        I receive You today as my Lord and Savior. Write my name in the Book of Life.
        I am born again; I am now a Kingdom Citizen. I am no longer merely earthly,
        but a heavenly being.”
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-10 font-bold">Know Your Rights as a Kingdom Citizen</h2>

      <h3>1. You Are a New Creation</h3>
      <p>
        2 Corinthians 5:17 – “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature:
        old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”  
        As you have given your life to Christ, you become a new citizen of a new
        Kingdom and a member of God’s family on earth. You possess Heaven’s “green
        card” and are entitled to the second resurrection; the second death has no
        power over you (2 Cor 5:17; 1 John 4:5).
      </p>

      <h3>2. Your Sins Are Forgiven</h3>
      <p>
        Romans 8:1 – “There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in
        Christ Jesus.” Salvation is a product of grace, not works. Grace grants you
        justification in the sight of God. By the blood of Jesus your sins are
        forgiven; you are made clean and perfect. When the devil reminds you of
        former sins, tell him to get lost and recite Romans 8:1.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Free from Curses</h3>
      <p>
        Galatians 3:13 – “Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being
        made a curse for us, for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on
        a tree.” You are now free from every curse—poverty, failure, sickness,
        barrenness. No demonic agent or charm can harm you (Num 23:23; Isa 54:17;
        Luke 10:19).
      </p>

      <h3>4. Satan Is Under Your Feet</h3>
      <p>
        Ephesians 1:21 – God “raised us up together and made us sit together in
        heavenly places in Christ Jesus, far above all principality and power.”
        Your new status makes you victorious over the devil and his works
        (Psalm 82:5-6; John 10:34-35).
      </p>
