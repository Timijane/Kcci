    <p>Dear Kingdom citizen<br>
    It is not by accident that you are here today we believe that God occasioned your presence in today's service because he loves you and wants to bless you richly.  
    The entire congregation of Kingdom citizens church wish to warmly welcome you to this church.</p>

    <p>By his grace he gave us the mandate to restore the Lost souls and destinies back into Christ Kingdom for preservation through the preaching of the word of faith.  
    Therefore we are committed to helping you discover the great future that God has in-store for you then ultimately have back what the devil has stolen from you.</p>

    <h2>Who is Kingdom citizen?</h2>
    <p>By creation man was made in the class of God Adam in the Garden of Eden by God's wisdom named all the animals one by one but when he fell his wisdom was corrupted.  
    It did not away with the nature of God for the nature of the devil in sin wickedness etc every mortal being shared this nature with Adam by natural birth for the one born of the flesh is of flesh and one born spirit is spirit John 3:5–6 Rom 3:23.  
    But thank God for Jesus who died for you and he wants to spend eternity with you but you have a part to play. You have to accept what he has for you—you have to accept that Jesus Christ is your Lord and your Savior.  
    To do this, pray this prayer along with me:</p>

    <p><em>Lord Jesus I am a sinner forgive me my sin. I know you died for me, I know you rose up on the third day.  
    Lord Jesus wash me with your blood, come into my heart. I receive you today as my Lord and Savior. Write my name in the Book of Life. I am born again, I am now a kingdom citizen.  
    I am no longer an earthly being but a heavenly being.</em></p>
