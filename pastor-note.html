    <p>Dear Kingdom citizen,<br>
    It is not by accident that you are here today; we believe that God occasioned your presence in today's service because He loves you and wants to bless you richly. The entire congregation of Kingdom Citizens Church INT'L warmly welcomes you.</p>

    <p>By His grace He gave us the mandate to restore the lost souls and destinies back into Christ’s Kingdom for preservation through the preaching of the word of faith. Therefore we are committed to helping you discover the great future that God has in store for you and ultimately recover what the devil has stolen from you.</p>

    <h2>Who is a Kingdom Citizen?</h2>
    <p>By creation man was made in the class of God. Adam in the Garden of Eden by God's wisdom named all the animals one by one, but when he fell his wisdom was corrupted. It did away with the nature of God for the nature of the devil in sin and wickedness. Every mortal being shared this nature with Adam by natural birth (John 3:5–6; Romans 3:23).  
    But thank God for Jesus who died for you and wants to spend eternity with you. You have a part to play: accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.  
    Pray this prayer along with me:</p>

    <p><em>Lord Jesus I am a sinner, forgive me my sin. I know you died for me, I know you rose on the third day. Lord Jesus wash me with your blood, come into my heart. I receive you today as my Lord and Savior. Write my name in the Book of Life. I am born again, I am now a Kingdom citizen. I am no longer an earthly being but a heavenly being.</em></p>

You posses Heaven's green card and entitled to Second resurrection, Second death has no power over you. 2Corinthian 5:17, 1john4:5</p>

    <h3>2. Your Sins Are Forgiven</h3>
    <p>There is therefore now no condemn to those who are in Christ Jesus Rom. 8:1 Salvation is a product of grace not of works. Grace grant you Justification in the sight of God. It t is important for you to know that by the blood of Jesus your sins are forgiven. You are throughly made clean and perfect. Jesus Coming into your life has uprooted the seed of sin in you and replace with the seed of holiness, So when the devil comes to remind you or accuse you of your former Sins tell him to get lost. Recite.8omans 8:1 … 2 Corinthians 5:21</p>

    <h3>3. Free from Curses</h3>
    <p>Galatians 3:13 Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangs on a Tree" You are now free from every curse. The Curse of poverty, failure, Sickness. Barrenness, Family Curses or Demonic agent can't place any curse on you nor can any charm have effect on you. Num 23:23 Eph: 23:25-26 Isa. 54:17 Luke 10:19</p>

    <h3>4. Satan Is Under Your Feet</h3>
    <p>Ephesians 1:21 And hath raise us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus"  "Far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come. As and heavenly citizen you are seated together with Jesus in heavenly places for above witches wizard accuutic  power, Satan himself. Your new Status makes you a god over the devil and his evil work name them. Ps 82:5-60John 10:34–35</p>
